 Aurei are a set of 888 gold and silver coins + mementos to celebrate the Philosopher King Mutant Aurelius (@MutantAurelius)

 There are 4 types of coins:
 1) Aureus Coins: The majority of coins in the collection; your typical NFT that can be minted, traded, etc.
 2) Small Council Coins: 6 coins that are minted by the contract owner and exclusively managed by the contract owner. These coins cannot be traded. They only move when the contract owner wants to change their owner. Coins #2-#7
 3) Owner Coins: These are 2 coins set aside to belong to @MutantAurelius (#1) and @femmedecentral (#888)
 4) Memento Coins: When Small Council Coins move wallets, they leave behind a memento as a small token of thanks. There is no limit to the number of mementos that can be minted. 

 In addition to the 4 coins with these properties, the contact has some additional features:

 1) A shitlist - Wallets that are banned from ever receiving a Aureus or Memento
 2) All coins will be revealed at mint. Users can either mint the next available Aureus or specify a token ID to mint. 
 3) An initial 1 coin / wallet limit, but that limit can be relaxed by the owner. 
 4) An allowlist. Only users on the allowlist can mint when Allowlist is active. Minting favorite is only possible when allowlist is active. 

 We also want to make sure that:
 1) The TokenURI / BaseURI can be swapped or updated as needed
 2) The owner can withdraw any funds
 3) The shitlist can be updated at any given time

 In case anyone would like to use these mechanics in the future, we're introducing two NFT mechanics features:
 1) "owner managed tokens" - tokens that can be moved to wallets exclusively by owner, and a momento is left behind. Inspired by https://theworm.wtf/
 2) "shitlist" - an updatable list of wallets that cannot mint or own. sometimes there are consequences.
